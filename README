Sublime plugin to find bad coding and correct it using regex to replace in all selected code.

For installation:

Linux:
1) Copy or make symbolic link to the file plugin in ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Package/User
 or simply run in terminal: 
 ln -s replacer.py ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Package/User/replacer.py

Windows 7/8:
1) Copy the plugin file in "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User" where <username> is your windows user

Windows XP:
1) Copy the plugin file in "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User"

OSX:
1) Copy the plugin file in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User


2) Binding command or launch. Plugin can be launched at sublime console(go to View_>Show Console) as:
*Remember that plugin works on your current selection (you can select all your code with command(ctrl in windows or linux)+a) or you can select manually what part of your code want to apply and then run:
view.run_command('beautycode')

Or you can keybind with your user keyboard config this can be done going to:
Sublime menu->Preferences->Key Binding User
and add the line:
{ "keys": ["ctrl+4"], "command": "beautycode" }

where ctrl+4 is your favorite key bind.



Happy Coding :)
